# Cursor Rules for Portfolio Website

## Project Context
Modern portfolio website using React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Code Style
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- Tailwind CSS for all styling (no inline styles)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Component Patterns
- All section components use IntersectionObserver for scroll detection
- Props interfaces must be defined for all components
- Use `viewport={{ once: true }}` for scroll animations
- Section IDs match component names (lowercase)

## Styling
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively
- Primary color: `primary-400` to `primary-600`
- Background: `gray-900` (main), `gray-800` (sections)
- Text: `gray-100` (primary), `gray-300` (secondary)
- Use `gradient-text` class for accent text

## Animation Guidelines
- Animation duration: 0.3-0.6 seconds
- Use `staggerChildren` for sequential animations
- Hover effects: scale(1.05) with smooth transitions
- Scroll animations: fade in + slide up

## File Structure
- Components in `src/components/`
- PascalCase for component files
- One component per file
- Export default for components

## Best Practices
- Always define TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

## When Adding Features
- Follow existing patterns
- Update TypeScript types
- Maintain design consistency
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Add smooth animations
- Test in multiple browsers
